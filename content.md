<!-- 
### Find your stake key ###
<i>This is where there should be links to specific wallets</i>
 -->
To get your stake key, head to pool.pm and put a forward / followed by your address. When the page has loaded, you can click on the stake key snippet and copy the full stake key from the address bar.



<!-- ### Delegate to the Pool/How to find the right pool ### -->

If you are only staking ada,  selecting a rugpool is pretty straigforward. You can just stake to your favorite of the pools and call it a day. However, if you would like to maximize the rug, you should check out pool-ski. 

Once you are on the site, click the "ada pool stats" button. Basic maffs will tell you that the less ada staked in a pool, the more hosky per ada you will receive.

If you have cash-grab nft's which you would like to stake to earn hosky, things get much more complicated. Welcome to the madness!

<!-- Find the best rugpool for you 
  - elvis sorter -->
Head to the link above this video. Click the "go-to hosky ranking" link and input your address. After you click the "load-address" button, select show pools and scroll to the bottom to view your pool matches.    


  <!-- - sort Command -->
If you are happy with the pool that you are currently staking with but loooking to maximize your worthlessness by moving only some of the cash grabs to another rugpool.....you will want to use the sort command as it will not include nft's that match your current pool.


If you feel you are being ruggd in your current pool, you may want to try the sort raw command. This will show matches to other pools for all of the cash-grabs in the wallet.

  <!-- - new site guy -->
Head to the link above this video. Put your address or stake or stake key in and click the "rug me daddy" button. On the left you will see a list of all the rugpools and the number of nft's you have that match each pool.



<!-- Once you have delegated to a rugpool, you will need to cross 2 epoch boundaries before you can claim rewards.......meaning...if you stake in epoch xx7 (before the start of epoch xx8) you will be able to claim your rewards in epoch xx9 (Possible link to infographic here) -->


<!-- ### Show checking the XLS ### -->

Until the website is complete, in order to check your rewards for the epoch you should head to the hosky discord.

Once in the discord, head to the rugpools announcement channel. There you will find...... when PDF!!!!!.  Skip the PDF and download the XLS file.

Once you have the spreadsheet file downloaded, you will be able to select the "accumulated rewards sheet" at the bottom of your spreadsheet application. 

Search for your stake key and........ZERO! You will see the amount of hosky that you will receive if you send to the rugpool bowl. 

If your rewards are less than 12.5 million hosky, you have the option to let them roll over until the next epoch. Once the accumulated total is over 12.5 million hosky you will need to send 2 ada to the rugpool bowl address before the epoch ends or you will lose your rewards. 

If you are staking with WRFGS, the accumulation limit is 100 million because you are donating your ada rewards.





<!-- ### Pulling from the bowl ### -->

On the hosky io website, you will find 2 bowls. To claim the worthless tokens you have earned for staking with a rugpool, click the brown bowl. 

When you send exactly 2 ada to the address shown, you will receive the number of hosky tokens that were shown for you stake key in the XLS.

To send, copy the address that is in the popup window and then head to your favorite wallet.

Paste the address that you copied, and put 2 ada in for the amount to send.  

Sign the transaction..........and wait.
