    title: "Stake with a Rug Pool",
    text: `<h3>What are the Rugpools?</h3>
          <p>Cardano is a proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, and its users (you, the 
            ada holder) help secure it by delegating their wallets to a decentralized 
            network of Stake Pools (SPOs) who then process blocks. As part of Hosky's 
            goal to expand the Cardano ecosystem, they've partnered with several SPOs 
            to encourage staking participation and reward network participants with 
            Hosky token. 
          </p>
          <h3>How do they work?</h3>
          <p>Delegating to an SPO rewards the delegator with Ada automatically as part 
            of how the cardano blockchain operates. However, if you delegate to one of 
            the specified Hosky rug pools, you'll have the option to send 2 ada each 
            epoch to $rugpool in exchange for bonus hosky rewards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Rug Pool currently receives an equal amount of 11,363,636,363 Hosky/epoch 
            (WRFGS is ADA only and gets 20 Billion, cuz ADA rewards are donated). This amount is split 
            between rewards for ADA staked (60%) and for the NFTs held (40%) in that staked 
            wallet. The more popular a Rug Pool becomes for ADA or NFTs, the lower the Hosky 
            per asset (ADA or NFT) is earned. NFTs have additional variations in the amount of Hosky they 
            earn depending on bonuses.
          </p>
          <h3>What's this I hear about Cash Grabs/ Nft bonuses?</h3>
          <p>Cash Grabs are a collection of 420420 nfts minted in 2021-2022. Staking 
            them (to a rugpool), in addition to a few other nft collections will earn Hosky 
            rewards from the NFT allocation. The Hosky earned is calculated based on a combination of:
            <ul>
              <li>- number of CGs, Gnomeskies, and S#!tties in the wallet</li>
              <ul>
              <li>
                CG's and Gnomeskies earn a base weight, the bonuses will add from there (the S#!tties
                are a multiplier for CG's only[x1.5] and don't earn rewards by themselves)
              </li>
              </ul>
              <li>- how long the CGs and Gnomeskies have remained in the wallet</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Each NFT(except S#!tties) earn 20% loyalty/epoch staked with the same rugpool 
                until after 5 epochs the rewards are doubled, and lost if switching rugpools.
              </li>
              </ul>
              <li>- which traits those nfts have and which SPO they're in</li>
              <ul>
              <li>
                Both CGs and Gnomeskies have certain traits (e.g. hats, backgrounds, etc.) which 
                result in a doubling of the base weight if 1 (or more) of the traits match the pool to which
                it is staked (no stacking for multiple traits).
              </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are tools to help you find the best pool for your taste <a href="#staking-how-to" class="internal">here</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have decided to stake to a rugpool you are probably wondering how you know when you can claim rewards. Please see the following
            graphic which explains how newly staked assets are rewarded.

            When staked to a Rug Pool, Gnomeskies allow you to earn from that Rug Pool’s Hosky NFT allocation. Standard Gnomeskies have 1500 base

            You will need to send 2 ada to the rugpool bowl every epoch(unless you meet the 
            accumulation limits). You can find the address on hosky.io when you click on the brown bowl.
          </p>
          <p>
            A report (known as the “PDF” or “spreadsheet”) is created each epoch based on a snapshot of 
            the state of the Cardano network, and posted in the #rugpool-announcements channel. Searching by 
            “stake address” which is available when staked to a Rug Pool will let you know how much Hosky will be 
            returned when “pulling” from the $rugpool address. Being a member of the official Discord channel 
            and reviewing that report is the only way to see rewards before pulling.
            Hosky rewards less than 12.5M in total will accumulate until they exceed 12.5M.
